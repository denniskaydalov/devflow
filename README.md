# Dev Flow

## Inspiration 

In an era where agility is the key to success, especially for small businesses and startups, we noticed a gap in the market for affordable, easy-to-use project management tools that combine the simplicity of a Kanban board with the power of AI-driven insights. While enterprise-level tools like Jira are excellent for large teams, they tend to overwhelm smaller teams with unnecessary complexity, hindering productivity rather than boosting it. Our goal was to create a solution that empowers small businesses and development teams to optimize their workflow, unlocking the same level of efficiency that large corporations enjoy, and transforming the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) into a more streamlined, intuitive process.

## What it does

Completely automated and self-directing Kanban board, encouraging a friction free workflow and increasing efficiency.

The board is split into 4 key categories: In-Dev, In-Test, In-Review and Done. As the ticket progresses in GitHub from one development stage to the next, it will do so automatically on our board as well, containing essential information such as status, assignee, reporter and branch. 

## How we built it

TS & React, Python, AWS and Databricks.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning the intricacies of what it takes to create a business process model, and integrating GitHub-related functions with an intuitive front-end display


## What's next for devflow

Incorporating AI-related components, such as Cohere API to generate summaries to concisely capture the essence of a repo, branch or individual ticket
