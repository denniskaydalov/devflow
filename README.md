# Dev Flow

## Inspiration 

In an era where agility is the key to success, especially for small businesses and startups, we noticed a gap in the market for affordable, easy-to-use project management tools that combine the simplicity of a Kanban board with the power of AI-driven insights. While enterprise-level tools like Jira are excellent for large teams, they tend to overwhelm smaller teams with unnecessary complexity, hindering productivity rather than boosting it. Our goal was to create a solution that empowers small businesses and development teams to optimize their workflow, unlocking the same level of efficiency that large corporations enjoy, and transforming the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) into a more streamlined, intuitive process.

## What it does

Completely automated and self-directing Kanban board, encouraging a friction free workflow and increasing efficiency.

## How we built it

TS & React, Python, AWS and Databricks.

## Challenges we ran into

Working to integrate JavaScript and TypeScript within a singular project, and account 

## What's next for devflow

Incorporating AI-related components, such as Cohere API to generate summaries to concisely capture the essence of a repo, branch or individual ticket
